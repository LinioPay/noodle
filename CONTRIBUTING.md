# Contributing

I wrote this library to to satisfy a need that I had, which means it may not fit for your use
case. I hope to change that whenever possible. Contributions are absolutely welcome, whether
in the form of code, documentation, bug reports, or feature requests.

Code MUST be accompanied by unit tests and adhere to the PSR-2 coding standard. If any
existing tests are broken as a result, they must be fixed to pass as well.

Bug reports or feature requests should be accompanied with as much detail as possible in
order to expedite their being handled. Examples, information on your use case, etc... are
all very helpful.

As for documentation, I'm happy to merge even minor spelling / grammar corrections. Feel free
to send them!
